Hi everyone!
My name is Bryan Wang and welcome to the portfolio.
Files listed with the extension .ipynb are done via Jupyter.
To be further updated with files 
The main idea is to showcase 3 sections. 

  1. Data Wrangling and Cleaning
  2. Machine Learning codes with Numpys and Pandas
  3. Data Visualisations.
